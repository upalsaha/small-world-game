Mom: So did you sell any cars today? Or were you too busy at the bar –
Dad: At the bar, and wish I still was. I’ve been home for less than 5 minutes and you’re already berating me
Mom: Well if you came home at a decent time and helped with things like cleaning the dishes I wouldn’t be all over your ass
Dad: <Mumbles> I remember a time when I loved being on your ass…
Mom: what?
Dad: Nothing.
Mom: Screw you. Maybe I wouldn’t be so bitchy if you helped without me asking
Dad: YOU WANT ME TO DO THE DISHES! I’LL FUCKING DO THE DISHES!
Mom: THAT’S NOT WHAT I FUCKING SAID!
Dad: you just said you want me to do the dishes!
Mom: No, I want you to WANT to do the dishes!
Dad: WHO THE HELL WANTS TO DO DISHES?!
Mom: That’s it, I’m moving into my mom’s place tomorrow. You’re nothing but a degraded shart in the wind.
